# DSharpPlus-Bot
Discord Bot made using D#+ API on .net

The bot was created on Windows 10, and will not work with Windows 7 or below.

The latest version of .net core  was used to run this C# application, and for privacy reasons, the JSON file
used to initialize the bot has been removed. To use this code on your own, therefore, the exampleconfig.json file must be given a token (creatable from the discord developer portal: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and renamed to "config.json".

Furthermore, the nuget packages "DSharpPlus 3.2.3", "DSharpPlus.CommandsNext 3.2.3", and "DSharpPlus.Interactivity 3.2.3", and "Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0" were installed. I am unsure if the current files will have it built in, or if they will need to be installed seperately on your machine.

On my end, I must simply press the run function. I am unsure of what you will have to do aside from the norm to run this (outside of Jetbrains Rider).

Thank you,

Victor Fong
